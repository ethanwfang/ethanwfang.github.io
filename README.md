This is my first personal website using HTML and CSS. I've always wanted
a website for me to display my photography and stuff about myself, and this was
the perfect place for me to do that. <br>

I spent quite a bit of time learning about front-end styling. I used flexbox styling for the "Gallery" page, and I plan to use 
grid styling for my "Projects" page.
