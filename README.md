This is my first personal website using HTML and CSS. I've always wanted
a website for me to display my photography and stuff about myself, and this was
the perfect place for me to do that. <br>

I spent quite a bit of time learning about front-end styling. I used flexbox styling for the "Gallery" page, and I plan to use 
grid styling for my "Projects" page.<br>

There is still some compatability issues between Mac users and Windows users which I've discovered. I want to learn more about
how I can fix this in the future, but it should be a minor issue for now.
