        <h4 class = "introparagraph">My name is Ethan Fang and I am based out of the San Francisco, Bay Area. 
          I am currently pursuing a BSE in Computer Science from Case Western Reserve University, planning to graduate early in 2025.
          My planned concentrations are Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. 
          Along the way, I plan to minor in mathematics and finance. 
          I would love to work on any project, whether it be AI, Quantum Computing, Full-Stack, etc. All of it sounds interesting!

          Growing up, I was nationally ranked in junior tennis, and spent most of my time training or playing tournaments.
          I've also played the violin since as early as I can remember, and played in the school orchestra as well as the California AllState Honor Orchestras every year.
          At school, I continue these passions with the CWRU Club Tennis Team and the Case Symphony Orchestra.

      <!--Coding Experience-->

        <h3 class="headers">Experience</h3>
          <h4 class = "introparagraph">
            In the summer of 2021, I interned with the Dosenet, Radwatch group at UC Berkeley to investigate the correlation between radiation and smoke particulates in the air.
            From this experience I wrote and published an article with <a class="link-text" href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Are-radioactive-wildfires-the-next-on-16737625.php">the San Francisco Chronicle</a> informing the public about the potential dangers of a radioactive world.

            Currently, I am working full time as an Undergraduate Student Research with the Solar Durability Energy and Lifetime Extension Center.
            I am developing statistical models, image-processing, and deep learning approaches by training on XRD patterns using Python and Tensorflow.
            <span><br><br></span>
            I am also currently working on 2 projects--this personal website, and an IOS receipt splitter calculator with a couple friends.
            Progress on the IOS app is coming soon, and I am excited to share with the world our idea and the progress of releasing it in the App Store.
